### What I learned

This one was quite the learning experience for me. It has been a while since I touched Javascript. I had a fair bit of trouble getting the navbar to work and I don't think I did it the most elegantly this time, but I learned a lot about how the css, html, and JS work with each other to achieve the result I ended up with. Other than that I gained a better understanding of SVG's and how they behave with css/html. I also used the picture object for the first time which is quite useful for switching image sources based on screen size.

### Continued development

I want to better utilize JavaScript and to be able to write it more elegantly. I am looking forward to taking what I learnt from this challenge to create a better navbar in the next one.
